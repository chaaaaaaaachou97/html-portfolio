            <h3>Dirty Dancing</h3>
                <p>I love Patrick Swayze and his acting.<br />
                I enjoyed watching the dancing lessons and their love story beginning.</p>
            <h3>L'Ascension</h3>
                <p>That's a great French movie about getting out of your comfort zone.<br />
                They show that people can literally move mountains for love and are capable of the craziest things.</p>
            <h3>Simone, le voyage du si√®cle</h3>
                <p>Giving insights about Simone Veil's life, this movie is a masterpiece.<br />
                I love how they show us her fights, both in her personal and professional life.</p>
